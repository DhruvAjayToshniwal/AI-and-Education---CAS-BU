#  Evaluating Gemini and ChatGPT for Environmental Science Education 

This project aims to analyze and visualize ratings data collected from two different sources and perform various data analysis tasks.

## Overview

The project is divided into three main components:

1. **Data Analysis:** In this part, we load and analyze the ratings data from the new CSV file `ratingResponse.csv`. We calculate the mean ratings for each prompt per category across all questions and visualize the results using bar charts.

2. **Visualization:** This section involves visualizing the interconnected triplets derived from OpenAI's API and creating mind maps based on the provided prompts.
